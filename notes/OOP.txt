**OOP Principles

-Rules of thumb for organizing projects into objects.

-SOLID
	-Single Responsibility
		-Most important rule
		-Do one thing and do it well.
		-A class/object/module should only have ONE responsibility.
		-Everything that a class does should be part of one responsibility
		-After you write a function, look at it and see if there are things that you can take out and make into other functions (use a wrapper function to call multiple functions is ok.)
	-Open-Closed Principle
		-Modules should be open to extension, but closed to modification
		-ROT: if i hav eto open the JS file and make a modification to extend it, it fails this test.
	-Liskov Substitution Principle
		-If it looks like a duck, quacks like a duck, but needs batteris you have the wrong abstraction
	-Interface Segragation Principle
		-Make as simple as possible to interface/use the module
	-Dependency Inversion Principle
		-Don't rely on one implementation?
-Single Responsibility
	
	
-Loosely coupled
	-Every object should work independently from the other objects that you write.
