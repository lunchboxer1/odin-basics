Fizz bizz

Problem:
Write a program that takes a users input and outputs integers from 1 to that number.  If a the number is divisible b y 3 than instead output fizz, if divisible by 5 output buzz.  If divisible by 5 and 3 output fizzbuzz.

Plan:
Is there a UI: Command line only
Inputs: User's number from the command line
Outputs: numbers from 1 to COUNT.  Except divisible by 3 = fizz, divisibile by 5 = buzz and divisible by 3 and 5 = fizz buzz

Psuedo Code:
Get user's input
Loop 1 to INPUT
	if i divisible by 3 & 5 => output fizzbuzz
	else if i divisible by 3 => output fizz
	else if i divisible by 5 => output buzz
	else output fizzbuzz
