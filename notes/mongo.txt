-Structure
	-Data is stored in BSON documents. 
		-BSON is binary representation of JSON
	-Document is effectively kust a JSON object
		-ROughly equivalent to a row in SQL
	-COllections are groups of documents
		-Roughly equivalent to a table in SQL
	-Every document MUST have an _id field which must be unique for every document.  Immutable, can set to anything you want except arrays. 
	
-CRUD
	-Standard methods for interacting with databases
	-Create
		-insertOne()
		-insertMany()
			-If ordered is set to true, docs will be inserted in the order of the array.  If one fails, the rest of the insert operation will fail.
	-Read
		-findOne()
			-finds the first doc that matches, only returns ONE document, even if it finds multiples
			-takes an object, sending empty will return one document
		-find()
			-finds multiple documents.
			-returns a cursor
			-Cursor allows you to to traverse over the result of a query
				-sort() method
				-limit() 
				-toArray()
			
	-Update
		-updateOne()
			-takes filter object and update object.
			-Filter is same as the read object
			-update has a bunch of update operators.
				-Example: { $set: { "bed": 3}}
				-set, min, max, inc, currentDate,mul, rename,
	-Delete
	
-Comparison Query Operators
	-Add to queries to narrow searchs.
	Example: 
		{ bedrooms: {$gte: 5}
		}
	-eq: equal to
	-gt greater than
	-gte: greater than or equal to
	-in: in the array
	-lt: less than
	-lte: less than or equal to
	-ne: not equal
	-nin: matches none of the values specificed
